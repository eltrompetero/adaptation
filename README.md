# Adaptation model

## Introduction
Code for the manuscript "Niche-constructing memory" by Edward D. Lee, Jessica C.
Flack, and David C.  Krakauer. Code is written by Eddie Lee. 

## Instructions
Functions for reproducing figures are in the file "pipeline.py". The
specification of the Python 3 environment used to generate the results are in
"adaption.yml".

## System specification
This code requires Python 3.7.5 and was run on a 64-bit Ubuntu system with an AMD
Ryzen 7 1700, 32GB RAM, and 256GB of swap space (some of the simulations require
a substantial amount of RAM).

## Troubleshooting
For any questions about the code and results, please open an issue on the GitHub
page [https://github.com/eltrompetero/adaptation].
