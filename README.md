# Adaptation model
### Author: Eddie Lee, edlee@santafe.edu

## Instructions
Code for "Niche-constructing memory" by Edward D. Lee, Jessica C. Flack, and David C.
Krakauer. Functions for reproducing figures are in the file "pipeline.py". The
specification of the Python 3 environment used to generate the results are in
"adaption.yml".

## System specification
This code requires Python 3 and was run on a 64-bit Ubuntu system with an AMD Ryzen 7
1700, 32GB RAM, and 256GB of swap space (some of the simulations require a substantial
amount of RAM).

## Troubleshooting
For any questions about the code and results, please open an issue on the GitHub page.
